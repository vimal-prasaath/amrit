But it’s not necessarily risk-free, like any surgical procedure. Preparation for cataract surgery side effects can help you both understand what to expect in the days following surgery and when to call if you experience something that's out of the ordinary. Read on to learn more about the most common side effects, potential complications, and the practical steps to achieve a quick, safe healing.",

      {
        subheader: "Blurry Vision",
        text: "One of the most common problems after cataract surgery is blurry vision, which many patients experience during the initial stages of recovery. This is generally a short-term issue that occurs as your eye adjusts to the new intraocular lens (IOL) and the healing process progresses. Blurry vision is your eye's way of adapting to the changes following the procedure, and it typically improves over time.",
        text2:
          "Recovery Tip: To support your recovery, it is advisable to rest your eyes during the first few days after surgery. Avoid looking at screens or engaging in activities like reading for extended periods, as these can put additional strain on your eyes.

This happens because the healing process and adjustment to the new lens can make your eyes more sensitive to bright light, particularly sunlight or artificial lighting. This can cause discomfort, especially outdoors or in brightly lit areas.",

This can make driving or being in poorly lit conditions challenging, but it is important to note that this is a temporary side effect of cataract surgery. These visual disturbances are your eyes adjusting to the new IOL and will usually resolve on their own after a few days of healing.",

          "Recovery Tip: To reduce inflammation and support the healing process, use the prescribed anti-inflammatory eye drops as directed by your doctor. These drops are essential for easing inflammation, promoting faster recovery, and ensuring a smoother healing process.

        text: "What you put inside your body makes a difference. A healthy diet full of fibre, protein, and all the foods your body needs keeps your energy up and flowing well with the labour process. Hydration is also key—the contractions become stalling if the patient becomes dehydrated, increasing the risk of a C-section. Drinking plenty of water ensures your body has what it needs for the demands of labour.",

Stretching and breathing techniques of yoga enhance flexibility, release tension, and induce relaxation. Many positions, such as the cat-cow stretch, can help to open the pelvis, making it easier for a baby to move through it. Mindfulness practices in yoga also reduce anxiety and enhance one's ability to manage pain when in labour.",
