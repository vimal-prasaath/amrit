        text: "Cataracts occur when the eye’s natural lens becomes cloudy, leading to blurred vision, difficulty with glare, and eventually, significant vision impairment. While glasses or stronger lighting can help manage early symptoms, surgery is the only way to effectively treat cataracts. During the procedure, the clouded lens is removed and replaced with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL), restoring clear vision.",

          "Delaying cataract surgery can have serious consequences. As cataracts progress, they can lead to complete blindness, making everyday tasks like reading, driving, or even recognizing faces increasingly difficult. Additionally, untreated cataracts can increase the risk of falls and accidents, particularly in older adults. Therefore, timely cataract surgery is essential to maintaining your independence and quality of life.",
